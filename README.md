#### Project status - Complete


## Introduction

A project using [streamlit](http://www.streamlit.io) to display and visualise the [latest information](https://statistics.gov.scot/downloads/cube-table?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdata%2Fcoronavirus-covid-19-management-information) from [statistics.gov.scot](https://statistics.gov.scot/).

Some of the data is not well suited to being displayed in the chart form that I am using, but the majority of information, and the variables I am most interested in (Testing - Positive cases in last 7 days, Testing - Daily people found positive, etc) are. More work can be done to make this dashboard more useful, and it remains a work in progress.
